# TorchDCM

Or a leftover of an ambitious approach of implementing DCM in pytorch. 

Right now it's basically an implementation of functions of the [VBA toolbox](https://github.com/MBB-team/VBA-toolbox) 
and now inference yet. Functions in the `matlab_stuff` folder are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. 

The notebook `dcm_animations.ipynb` creates gifs, differentiating between BOLD signals
and neuronal states.
